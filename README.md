# Balloon
ðŸŽˆ Modern server software based on Airplane that includes a more broad API.

**THIS IS A PERSONAL FORK FOR MY PERSONAL PROJECTS, PLEASE DON'T USE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!** It may not suit your use case and may have several changes that are either experimental or oddly specific to my servers!

## What is the point?
Balloon is built on Airplane for fast performance, and aims to patch up any missing but neccessary APIs that people might need.

## Credits
I set up this repo, but I have not written any of the patches myself yet (except for the rebranding)

This repo includes patches from:
  - Machine Maker - More world APIs
  
If you would like to see who wrote a patch, just open the file and it should be on the first few lines.
